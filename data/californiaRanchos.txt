ENTRODUCTIIONTHE RANCHOS OF CALIFORNIA       The original volume from which this book is taken,Burgess McK. Shumway’s Ranchos of California: PatentedPrivate Land Grants Listed by County, was one of a series ofnoteworthy research projects produced by the Federal Writ-ers Project of the Works Project Administration. The WPAwas a Depression-era attempt by the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt to provide paying jobs for thenation’s unemployed workers, including out-of-work artists,writers, and other creative individuals. The FWP took theseunemployed authors, and set them to producing state and citytravel guides, county records manuals, census indexes, localand regional histories, and a great many other projects of in-terest to the historian and researcher. Regrettably, many ofthe projected series were never finished, having been terminated with the outset of World War II. Also unfortunately,more than half of the books which did appear were publishedin mimeographed form only, in editions of no more than 250copies, with poor typography (often typed copy), inferiorpaper, and cheap bindings. Few copies survive today, andmost of these are brittle, faded, and difficult to read.       Shumway’s project, originally produced in 1940-41,anticipated Robert G. Cowan’s Ranchos of California: A Listof Spanish Concessions, 1775-1822, and Mexican Grants,1822-1846 (Historical Society of Southern California, 1977),a thoroughly excellent work in its own right. But Cowan’swork was organized differently, by rancho name, and provided less detail than Shumway’s pioneering effort, which isavailable today in just a handful of large research collections.Thus, when a well-known California book dealer, AllanAdrian, suggested that a new edition of Shumway might beappropriate, Borgo Press obtained a copy of the original, hadit reset, and retitled it California Ranchos to avoid confusionwith Cowan's book. The book was also checked for typographical and other errors, and thoroughly indexed. RobertG. Cowan graciously consented to provide a new preface.       Shumway’s basic format, which organized the grantsby the present-day county boundaries into which they wouldnow fall, and then alphabetically by the name of the rancho,has been maintained in this new version. Ranchos straddlingtwo contemporary counties are listed in both. A typical en-try includes: rancho name, record number, present-daycounty/counties, area of grant, date of grant, governor mak-ing grant, recipient(s), repatented acreage, date of new patent, recipient(s), location.       The original Spanish and Mexican land grants wereissued under a loose metes and bounds system that emphasized contemporary physical landmarks to establish theboundaries of each grant; these were often sufficiently ill-defined to cause disputes at a later date, even prior to statehood. Consequently, a number of the ranchos were regranted a second time, sometimes to the same person(s) asbefore.       When California was admitted to the Union in 1850,it was erected as a public-domain state. Boundaries underthe public-domain system are determined from a theoreticalgrid based around north-south meridians and east-west baselines. Three principal meridians were established in Califor-nia between the years 1851-53: the Humboldt Meridian(HBM), located in northern California; the Mount DiabloMeridian (MDM), located in central California; and the SanBernardino Meridian (SBM), located in southern California.Intersecting these meridians at right angles are several baselines. Extending outward from these measures are six-mile-square townships, each having thirty-six one-mile-squaresections. The numbers listed at the end of each entry in thisbook describe the township(s) into which the rancho nowfalls, the letter “T” indicating the distance from the base line, the letter “R” indicating the distance from the meridian.Thus, “T IS, R11-12E, MDM” indicates that the rancho islocated in Township 1 South, Range 11-12 East of the MountDiablo Meridian.       Following establishment of state government in Cali-fornia, a Board of Land Commissioners was empowered (beginning in 1852) to adjudicate Spanish and Mexican claims.and to reissue properly surveyed patents using the publicdomain system now in effect. Some claims were rejected,others were not adjudicated until the 1880s, and still otherswound up in the courts. Many of the original grants hadlong since been sold, split into smaller sections through inheritance or sale, or been subject to fraudulent claims. Mostof the original records of the Board were destroyed in theSan Francisco earthquake and fire in 1906. This book onlylists those claims that were ultimately recognized as genuine,with new patents actually being issued.       Thanks to Allan Adrian for locating a copy of thisbook, and to the late Robert G. Cowan for providing a newintroduction.—Prof. Michael BurgessMary Wickizer BurgessSan Bernardino, California19 July 1988 & 22 August 2004
PREFACECALIFORNIA’S LAND GRANTS      The land we now know as California was discoveredin 1542 by Cabrillo, a Portuguese, flying the flag of Spain onthe stern of his ship, just fifty years after Columbus’s famousvoyage. This new discovery was called Alta California, BajaCalifornia having already been named by some of Cortes’smen eight or nine years earlier. California was first noted asan island on the world map of a respected, lotus-eatingDutch geographer; this mistake was copied by a number ofhis European colleagues, and the error persisted for a numberof years.      The so-called Manila galleons, laden with riches ofthe East destined for Spain, found the northern route to Mexico the most satisfactory of possible transit points. Thisbrought them to the coast of Alta California, but since theywere not geographers, explorers, or conquerors, they had nointerest in, and left no records of, what they saw.      In fact, none but a few buccaneers intruded on California life for nearly one hundred years. Sir Francis Drake,considered one of that brotherhood by the Spaniards, stoppedon the California coast in 1579 to careen his ship. He tookpossession of the land for Queen Elizabeth I of England,calling it Nova Albion, and then left after staying no morethan a month. England and Spain were not on the best ofterms at that time, so Elizabeth found no advantage in pressing her claims to a land so entirely remote and unknown.      The tranquility of California was not really disturbeduntil the avarice of King Carlos III of Spain induced him toestablish his claim through colonization, as had already beendone in Baja, to a point as far north as the Spanish blood would tolerate. This policy was activated in 1769, when themajor countries of Europe were already mounting severalscientific expeditions to Baja to observe a rare transit of theplanet Venus through the heavens. As the next transit wouldnot occur for 108 years, scientists from all the civilized statesof Europe were interested in getting as much data as possi-ble. and the best viewing point was off the coast of BajaCalifornia.       Carlos ordered an expedition by land and sea to settleat what is now San Diego in the year 1769. Here the firstmission was established, and within the next half centurytwenty more were built, spaced about one day’s foot-travelapart, north to Sonoma. Thus was the seed planted.       It was the King’s intention to have the missionsgather the Indians, and civilize and educate them to buildlittle communities around each church. The missions wereconceded land as needed, so long as they did not encroachupon the Indian rancherias. Three towns were laid out, withlots to live upon and plots to farm: Branciforte, San Jose,and Los Angeles, the first of these disappearing soon thereaf-ter. These towns were populated by convicts scraped out ofMexican jails, men and women who were promised freedomin exchange for hard labor and a chance at a new life.       An unexpected stratum of society emerged as early as1784. Retired soldiers from the Presidios of Monterey,Santa Barbara, and San Francisco, rather than returning totheir original homes in Mexico, asked for and received largeland concessions to support cattle ranches. There were twomajor restrictions on these grants: first, that the concessionswould not infringe on the Indian rancherias or their rights, oron the holdings of the twenty-one Franciscan missions. Thiswas generally observed. Second, that no one was to build oractually live on the concessions. This was always ignored.       In 1784 the first three concessions were granted byGovernor Fages to Dominguez, Verdugo, and Nieto, cover-ing a total of about 100,000 acres of land in Los Angeles andOrange Counties, and California’s pastoral period slowlycame into being. During the Spanish period, there werethirty-two major concessions awarded, ten by one generousGovernor alone. Even after the Mexican flag was raised, in 1822, there was no grand rush, fifteen grants being distributed in the first year, and then only twenty-five more overthe next decade.      In these early decades many ranchos owners, particularly in outlying areas, worried very little about their claims:“This land has no value—there is so much of it, no onewants mine—I know where it is—I surveyed it from my saddle with a reala—I know that it extends from this pile ofrocks with a cross on it (a mojonera) to the dry creek, andfrom the river to another mojonera—why should I botherabout a map and spend $ 12 for a grant?” Attitudes began tochange, however, after 1833.      By then a few foreigners, mostly English and American. had recognized the fact that the land could be used formany other useful purposes, and had joined the CatholicChurch, sometimes adopting Spanish names. They then either married into families that had land, or induced the owners to sell them pieces of existing grants. The Mexicans.who saw a chance to benefit themselves financially whilegetting rid of what they perceived to be largely worthlessproperty, were often all too eager to sell.      For the next thirteen years, ending with the Americanrebellion and conquest of 1846, about 700 ranchos weregranted by the Mexican governors, many of them to whitecarpetbaggers. These included some regrantings, duplications, and splitting of older, larger grants, now renamed bythe heirs or assigns. The last of these officials, the wily PioPico, in order to secure the Jamul Rancho originally awardedhim in 1831, made a new petition to himself, from himself;and then regranted it to himself, from himself—signed,sealed, and delivered.      The Californians had learned a few things from theAnglos.—Robert G. CowanLos Angeles, California11 April 1988
NOTE      According to U.S. surveys, a “league” is equivalentto 2.633573 miles or 5,000 varas. Other authorities list theleague as the equivalent of 8,000 varas (3.95 miles), with17.5 leagues equal to each degree of the Earth’scircumference. A square league in the U.S. survey system is6.935+ square miles, or roughly 4,438 acres. The Spanishyard, the vara, is equal to 2.781 feet, or 33.385 inches. Asitio usually refers to a residential plot of uncertain size.      Spanish place names used by many of the rancherosinclude: arroyo (stream or water course), bolsa (pouch orbag), Canada (glen or dale or ravine), canon (canyon or ravine), corral (corral), huerta (orchard or garden), laguna(lake), llano (level area), ojo (spring), paso (pass), potrero(pasture), punta (headland or point), rancho (ranch), rincon(corner formed by the meeting of two walls or mountainranges), rio (river), san(ta) (saint), sanjon or zanjon (deepditch), sausal or sauzal (willow grove), sierra (mountainrange), valle (valley).Dedicated to the memory ofRobert G.
